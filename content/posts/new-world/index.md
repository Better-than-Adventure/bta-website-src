Hello World.

This shiny new hub will serve as the new home for Better than Adventure, hopefully making it much easier to access news and updates in a fancy _search engine optimised_ format!

We have some **big** plans for this site. Eventually we aim to set up an in-depth installation guide, RSS feeds so you can stream new posts directly to your personal feed, Discord server, or whatever you fancy, and a forum to serve as the new homepage for BTA-related discussion. For now, you can view a selection of community submitted screenshots, or a backlog of helpful tips created by [@thaboarr](https://twitter.com/thaboarr) (Or contribute to our [wiki!](https://bta.miraheze.org))

Special thanks to Nebula and Nabrious for their help in working out the style and getting all this set up!
