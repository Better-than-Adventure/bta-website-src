Hello, everyone! Exactly 6 months on from 7.2 (seriously, go check) we're shipping 7.3 of Better than Adventure!, this update brings you new Netherrack blocks to build with, an easier way to paint things, and a couple new Redstone components to tickle your technical brain.

## Download

We recommend against using the automatic installer for the time being as we've been experiencing issues pulling the releases from Github.

For now, please download the MultiMC/Prism instance manually [here](/downloads).

## Installation

To manually install with MultiMC/Prism just drag and drop the downloaded ZIP file into your launcher. More details can be found [here](https://www.betterthanadventure.net/installation-guide) under _"Installation: MultiMC/Prism Instance"_.

If you need any assistance in installing or have a bug to report, then please submit a ticket to our new [issue tracker](https://bugs.betterthanadventure.net/).

Have a nice day! :-)
