Hello again!

v7.3_02 had some fairly nasty bugs related to multiplayer, so we're now releasing v7.3_03 to fix those.

### Features

-   Added new convenience recipes for dyeing items such as wool, wooden planks, signs, etc.
-   Improved description prompting option
    -   Never prompt: old item description rendering
    -   Prompt: Show "LCTRL: Show more..." prompt
    -   Always show: Always shows description

### Bug Fixes

-   Reverted LWJGL version from 3.3.4 to 3.3.3
-   Added missing hitbox for singular fence post blocks
-   Fixed duplicate right-click issue in multiplayer
-   Fixed an issue with baskets losing their contents on world load
-   Pistons now have proper sounds, and steel pistons now have proper blast resistance
-   Pumpkin carving recipe no longer stops functioning after viewing it in the guidebook

## Download

We still recommend against using the automatic installer for the time being. Please install the MultiMC instance manually [here](/downloads). Instructions on installing can be found below.

Still working on a new updater that we will release very soon!

## Installation

To manually install with MultiMC/Prism just drag and drop the downloaded ZIP file into your launcher. More details can be found [here](https://www.betterthanadventure.net/installation-guide) under _"Installation: MultiMC/Prism Instance"_.

If you need any assistance in installing or have a bug to report, then please submit a ticket to our new [issue tracker](https://bugs.betterthanadventure.net/).

Have a nice day! :-)
