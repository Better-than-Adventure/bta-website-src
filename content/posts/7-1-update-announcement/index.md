## Download

Our recommended download method is using the **BTA Updater**, a utility instance for MultiMC and Prism Launcher which, when run, will automatically install Better than Adventure! for you in an instance called "Better than Adventure! (Managed)".

You can find the link for this utility [here](/downloads), as well as a more traditional MultiMC instance and client and server JAR links.

## Installation

For those of you who already have the BTA Updater installed, you can simply run it and it will update your "Better than Adventure! (Managed)" instance to the latest version automatically, preserving all your worlds and settings as-is.

If you need any assistance in installing or have a bug to report, then please visit our [Discord](https://www.betterthanadventure.net/discord).

Enjoy! :)
