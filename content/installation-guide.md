## Installation: MultiMC/PolyMC/Prism Update Utility

The MultiMC update utility will allow you to automatically download and update to the latest release of BTA without having to install a brand new instance from the forum page!

-   To install the utility, simply drag and drop that link onto your MultiMC instance list, then run it. It'll generate a managed instance of BTA, which you can then run to launch the mod.
-   Whenever the mod releases a new update you can just run the update utility again and it'll automatically upgrade your managed instance to the latest version! No more messing around with jar files, and all your saves, screenshots and settings will be in exactly the same place

## Installation: MultiMC/PolyMC/Prism Instance

-   Download MultiMC and launch it.
-   Simply drag and drop the 'MultiMC instance' zip file into your MultiMC and it should appear on your instances screen. Alternatively, click "Add Instance", then "Import", locate the zip file and click "OK".
-   Load your newly created instance and play!

## How to run the server jar

-   Simply run it like you would an .exe file.
-   Warning! it will use the server.jar's host directory as a local directory meaning all the files it creates will be placed in whatever folder your jar is in! So try to put it in its own folder somewhere!
