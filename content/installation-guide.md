## Installation: MultiMC/Prism Instance

-   Download MultiMC and launch it.
-   Simply drag and drop the 'MultiMC instance' zip file into your MultiMC and it should appear on your instances screen. Alternatively, click "Add Instance", then "Import", locate the zip file and click "OK".
-   Load your newly created instance and play!
-   **If you are updating for an existing world you will need to copy your saves over to the new instance!**

## How to run the server jar

-   Simply run it like you would an .exe file.
-   Warning! it will use the server.jar's host directory as a local directory meaning all the files it creates will be placed in whatever folder your jar is in! So try to put it in its own folder somewhere!
